### F001: Structured Tool Usage Logging

- **Added:** 2026-01-25
- **Category:** enhancement
- **Priority:** medium
- **Status:** pending

Create `.opti-gsd/tool-usage.json` to track all tool calls (especially MCP tools) made by subagents during workflow execution, with task attribution.

**Components:**
1. PostToolUse hook to capture tool calls with timestamps
2. Task context injection so logs attribute calls to specific tasks (T01, T02, etc.)
3. Session grouping by phase/wave
4. New `/opti-gsd:tools usage` command to summarize tool usage patterns
5. Integration with executor agent to correlate tool calls with task completion

**Example Structure:**
```json
{
  "sessions": [{
    "started": "2026-01-25T10:30:00Z",
    "phase": 1,
    "entries": [
      {"task": "T01", "tool": "mcp__cclsp__find_definition", "file": "auth.ts", "ts": "..."},
      {"task": "T01", "tool": "Edit", "file": "auth.ts", "ts": "..."}
    ]
  }]
}
```
