### I003: Push before verify, PR before merge

- **Added:** 2026-01-19
- **Category:** feature
- **Priority:** high
- **Status:** completed (v0.8.0)

Change workflow to push working branch before verify (not after), and always create PR instead of auto-merging.

### I002: Enforce milestone branching

- **Added:** 2026-01-19
- **Category:** feature
- **Priority:** medium
- **Status:** completed (v0.7.0)

Commands like plan-phase and execute should check if working on base branch when `branching: milestone` is configured, and either warn or auto-create the milestone branch. Prevents accidental commits directly to master/main.
